  description: `The McCallister family prepares to spend Christmas in Paris, gathering at Peter and Kate's home in a Chicago suburb on the night before their departure. Peter and Kate's youngest son, Kevin, is the subject of ridicule by his older siblings and relatives, namely his older brother Buzz. Meanwhile, Harry Lyme, a burglar, poses as a police officer offering security advice in order to gather information about every house in the neighborhood, including the McCallister's. Right before Harry leaves, Kevin gets into a fight with Buzz after Buzz claims he ate all the plain cheese pizza not even a minute after it arrived, resulting in Kevin's plane ticket mistakenly being thrown away and him getting sent to the attic of the house as punishment. As Kate walks Kevin to the attic, she has a brief conversation with Harry. After Harry leaves, Kevin berates Kate and wishes that his family would disappear. During the night, heavy winds cause damage to the power lines; the resulting power outage (which everyone sleeps through and has ended by morning) resets the alarm clocks and causes the family to oversleep. In the confusion and rush to get to the airport, along with an accurate headcount when a neighbor's son passes by (mistaken for Kevin) coupled with no assigned ticket, Kevin is accidentally left behind.`,
